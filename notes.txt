DevOps is an increasingly common approach to agile software development that developers and operations teams use to build, test, deploy and monitor applications with speed, quality and control.

DevOps is relevant to any kind of software project regardless of architecture, platform or purpose. Common use cases include: cloud-native and mobile applications, application integration, and modernization and multicloud management.

Successful DevOps implementations generally rely on an integrated set of solutions or a "toolchain" to remove manual steps, reduce errors, increase team agility, and to scale beyond small, isolated teams.
